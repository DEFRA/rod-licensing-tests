# Rod Licensing Digital Service Tests

Mono-repo for the rod licensing digital service quality assurance tests

## Prerequisites

- Node v20+
- Docker v18.06.0+

## Cloning

Cloning via SSH from behind a firewall which blocks port 22:

```
git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/DEFRA/rod-licensing-tests
```

## Using Lerna

This project uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to simplify the management and versioning of multiple packages which comprise the rod licensing digital
service.

Running `npm install` in the root project will automatically run the `lerna bootstrap` command. The result is that any local packages which depend on
one another will be linked locally (using symbolic links).

Running `npm run lerna:clean` will remove all local node_modules.

Running `lernaupdate` will enter an interactive wizard to allow updates of each packages dependencies.

Running `lernaupdate --non-interactive --dependency "aws-sdk@latest"` will update the aws-sdk dependency in all packages which use it.

## Package structure

packages/

- [frontend-acceptance-tests](packages/frontend-acceptance-tests/README.md)
  > Acceptance tests for the Get a Fishing Licence frontend
- [frontend-performance-tests](packages/frontend-performance-tests/README.md)
  > Performance tests for the Get a Fishing Licence frontend

## Running Acceptance Tests Locally

1. Install the package dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2.  Navigate to the `frontend-acceptance-tests` package

   ```
   cd packages/frontend-acceptance-tests
   ```

3.  Install the package dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   Note: The first `npm install` in the root does not install the dependencies inside each module.

4.  Create a `.env` file in the `frontend-acceptance-tests` directory and copy the values from Jenkins Test configuration (https://fsh-jenkins.aws-int.defra.cloud/)

   ```
   touch .env
   ```

5.  Run the tests using:

   ```
   npm run local
   ```
